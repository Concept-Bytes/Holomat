# Calibration
Holomat tutorial part 2. Video for this project is on my patreon. 

## Description
These python scripts allow you to do the calibration required for the holomat project. They do camera calibration using a charuco board and 4 point calibration using openCV contours.

## Installation
Ensure Python and the necessary libraries are installed:
```
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

```
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```
## Usage
I strongly suggest following along with my video on patreon as there is a lot of debugging required to run this.
```
python calibration.py
```


## Requirements
Python 3.6 or later
OpenCV 4.0 or later
MediaPipe
NumPy
PyAutoGUI
